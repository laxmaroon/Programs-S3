A linked stack is a type of stack data structure that is implemented using a linked list. In a linked stack, each element in the stack is represented by a node in the linked list, and the top of the stack is represented by the head of the linked list.

The following is an example of a linked stack with three elements:
+---+    +---+    +---+
| 3 | -> | 2 | -> | 1 |
+---+    +---+    +---+
  ^
  |
head

In this example, the head of the linked list represents the top of the stack, and the value of the head node is 3. 
The second node in the linked list represents the next element in the stack, and its value is 2. 
The third node in the linked list represents the bottom of the stack, and its value is 1.

To push an element onto the stack, a new node is added to the head of the linked list. 
To pop an element from the stack, the head node is removed from the linked list.

Push 4:
+---+    +---+    +---+    +---+
| 4 | -> | 3 | -> | 2 | -> | 1 |
+---+    +---+    +---+    +---+
  ^
  |
head

Pop:
+---+    +---+    +---+
| 3 | -> | 2 | -> | 1 |
+---+    +---+    +---+
  ^
  |
head

In this example, the push operation adds a new node with value 4 to the head of the linked list,
 and the pop operation removes the head node, which has value 3.
