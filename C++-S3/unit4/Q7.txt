A circular linked list is a type of linked list where the last node points back to the first node, creating a circular structure.
 In other words, the next pointer of the last node in the list points back to the head of the list.

Example: Consider a circular linked list with three nodes, "A", "B", and "C", where node "A" is the head of the list and 
node "C" is the last node in the list. 
The next pointer of node "C" would point back to node "A".
+---+    +---+    +---+
| A | -> | B | -> | C |
+---+    +---+    +---+
  ^                   |
  |-------------------+

In a circular linked list, there is no end to the list, and the list can be traversed indefinitely. 
The advantage of a circular linked list over a regular linked list is that it can be used in applications where a loop is required, 
such as in the implementation of a queue.

Different representations of a circular linked list include:

Single Circular Linked List: In this representation, a single node points back to the head of the list, creating a circular structure.

Double Circular Linked List: In this representation, both the head node and the last node in the list point back to each other, 
creating a circular structure. 
This representation is useful in applications where both the head and tail of the list need to be accessed frequently.

Example: Consider a double circular linked list with three nodes, "A", "B", and "C". The next pointer of node "C" would point back to node "A", 
and the previous pointer of node "A" would point back to node "C".
+---+ <---+    +---> +---+ <---+    +---> +---+
| A |      | B |      | C |      | A |      | C |
+---+ ---> +---+ ---> +---+ ---> +---+ <--- +---+
  |                   |
  +-------------------+
In conclusion, a circular linked list is a type of linked list where the last node points back to the first node, creating a circular structure. 
There are different representations of a circular linked list, including a single circular linked list and a double circular linked list, 
each with its own advantages in specific use cases.
