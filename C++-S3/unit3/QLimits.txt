Disadvantages of linear queue:

Fixed size: The size of a linear queue is fixed and cannot be changed dynamically, which can result in the waste of memory.
Overflow: If we try to insert an element into a full queue, it will result in overflow.
Underflow: If we try to remove an element from an empty queue, it will result in underflow.
Circular Queue:
A circular queue is a type of queue that solves the limitations of a linear queue. In a circular queue, 
the rear pointer points to the first element after pointing to the last element. It makes the queue circular and eliminates the waste of memory.

circular queue

In the above diagram, after the removal of A, the front pointer moves to B, and the rear pointer points to C.
 After the removal of B, the front pointer moves to C, and the rear pointer still points to C. In this way, the front 
 and rear pointers continue to rotate, making the queue circular and allowing it to overcome the limitations of a linear queue.

In a circular queue, we can easily insert elements as the rear pointer points to the first element after pointing to the last element. 
We can also remove elements from the queue easily without encountering the overflow and underflow problems.
