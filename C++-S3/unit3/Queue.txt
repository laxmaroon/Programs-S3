A queue is a linear data structure that follows the FIFO (First-In-First-Out) principle. 
The data element that is inserted first will be the first to be removed. The insertion of elements takes place at the rear end and 
the removal of elements takes place at the front end.

In the above diagram, there are three elements present in the queue. 
The first element to be inserted is A, followed by B and then C. As we follow the FIFO principle, the first element to be removed will be A. 
After the removal of A, the front pointer moves to B. The next element to be removed will be B, and so on.

Queue Overflow:
Queue overflow occurs when we try to insert an element into a full queue. 
If the front pointer is not pointing to the first element and the rear pointer is pointing to the last element,
 then the queue is full, and no more elements can be inserted.

Queue Underflow:
Queue underflow occurs when we try to remove an element from an empty queue. If the front pointer is pointing to the first element and 
the rear pointer is pointing to the last element, then the queue is empty, and no more elements can be removed.
