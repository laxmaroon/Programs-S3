A circular queue is a type of queue data structure that operates in a circular fashion. 
It solves the limitations of linear queues and eliminates the waste of memory.

In the above diagram, the front pointer is pointing to the first element A, and the rear pointer is pointing to the last element C. 
After the removal of A, the front pointer moves to the next element B, and the rear pointer still points to C. 
In this way, the front and rear pointers continue to rotate, making the queue circular.

In a circular queue, the front and rear pointers rotate in a circular fashion, making it possible to insert and remove elements 
from the queue easily. When the front and rear pointers are pointing to the same element, it means the queue is empty. 
When the rear pointer points to the first element after pointing to the last element, it means the queue is full.

In a circular queue, the insertion of elements takes place at the rear end and the removal of elements takes place at the front end, 
following the FIFO (First-In-First-Out) principle. The data element that is inserted first will be the first to be removed.
